On Tuesday 29th March 2022 I will be representing Women in Research, Ireland at Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for a Rountable Discussion on Future Funding of Higher Education in Ireland.

For those who don't know it's like a joint table discussion at Houses of Irish Parliament, and the main goal is invitation of our views as members of Ireland's academic/research community, and in particularly representing women researchers in Ireland. Our plan is to cover the most pressing issue with regards to higher education in Ireland and how they affect women staff in Irish universities leading to an overall lower quality of education. In line with this DEI (diversity, equality and inclusion) initiatives in Irish universities will be a strong agenda item that we will be picking up.

It is indeed an honor to take up this significant role and more so as a migrant woman from Pakistan. When I came to Ireland to do my PhD studies I had never imagined a day would come when I could play a role, or at least put forward some recommendations for future policymaking with regards to higher education here.
