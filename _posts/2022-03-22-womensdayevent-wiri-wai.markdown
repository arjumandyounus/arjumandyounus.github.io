For International Women's Day this year Women in Research, Ireland and Women in AI, Ireland collaborated and put together an event with the theme BreakTheBias in Artificial Intelligence. 

As Sheryl Sandberg has put it, "We need women at all levels, including the top, to change the dynamic, reshape the conversation, to make sure women’s voices are heard and heeded, not overlooked and ignored."

I spoke alongside inspiring women Georgiana Ifrim & Iva Simon-Bubalo from academia, research, and industry under moderation of our amazing WAI committee member Haoio (Karin) Cheong. We celebrated the achievements, learned about each others' incredible journeys, and how passions for #AI, #DataScience, and #DataAnalytics are being pursued while also caring for our families. It was such an enjoyable chat and a great learning experience.

Here’s a teaser of our session. You can find the full version on Women in AI's Youtube account.
