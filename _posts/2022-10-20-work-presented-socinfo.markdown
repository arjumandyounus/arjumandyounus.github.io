Yesterday at SocInfo 2022 which happens to be a multi-disciplinary social computing conference my work was presented in the session on Politics. This is part of my involvement with the Irish Research Council's COALESCE funded project called InÉire: Inclusive Éire; and the chief idea revolves around analysis of Twitter content by native and migrant activists in Irish Twittersphere to assess their level of integration in Irish society.

Here's a prerecorded talk of the paper presentation
