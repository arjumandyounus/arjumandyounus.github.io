On Tuesday 21st June 2022 I will be representing Women in Research, Ireland during the second Irish RSA Online Forum on Research Careers. This year's theme is around a discussion of sustainable careers for researchers with a special focus on mobility, gender equality, and open science

The title of my talk will be "Rich Getting Richer in Academia: Long Way to go for Gender Equality Dream" where I will be speaking about academia as a very tough choice for women researchers; and the factors contributing to their slow growth when compared to male academics. Some of Women in Research Ireland's initiatives in this space will also be highlighted.
